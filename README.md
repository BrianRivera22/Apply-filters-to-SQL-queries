<h1>Apply filters to SQL queries</h1>

<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>As a security professional I can demonstrate that I can investigate security issues to help keep a system secure. In this activity I discovered some potential security issues that involved login attempts and employee machines.</p>
<p>My task was to examine the organizationâ€™s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. In each example I show my use of SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and  investigation of the potential security issues.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Here is my practical experience in using SQL to:</p>
<li>run SQL queries to retrieve information from a database</li>
<li>apply AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter SQL queries.</li>
